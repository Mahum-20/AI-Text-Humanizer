# AI-Text-Humanizer
AI Text Humanizer is a Django-based web application that refines AI-generated text, making it sound more natural and human-like. The tool uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, such as sentence shuffling and grammar correction, to improve the flow, readability, and quality of content that has been generated by AI models.
